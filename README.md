Introduction to end-to-end machine learning 


## Environment

First, install Anaconda (for windows):


Finally, run Jupyter in this folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


## Intructions

* First, train a model in `regression_carprice_blank.ipynb` (check `regression_carprice_reference.ipynb` for reference implementation)
* Then, implement a service in `flask_app_blank.py` (check `flask_app_reference.py` for reference implementation)
